# Returning from Functions
Certain functions, such as **int** or **str**, return a value instead of outputting it.

The returned value can be used later in the code, for example, by getting assigned to a variable.

To do this for your defined functions, you can use the **return** statement
```python
def sum(x , y):
    return x+y
```
Now we can use our function and assign the result to a variable
```python
def sum(x , y):
    return x+y

res = sum(15, 7)
print(res)
```
```
22
```
> Returning is useful when you don't need to print the result of the function, but need to use it in your code. For example, a bank account's **withdraw()** function could return the remaining balance of the account

You can use the returned value in your code, for example, an **if** statement

```python
def max(x, y):
    if x >= y:
        return x
    else:
        return y
    
if(max(8, 5) > 10):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("Nope")
```
```
Nope
```

Once you return a value from a function, it immediately stops being executed.

Any code placed after the **return** statement won’t be executed
```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    total = x + y
    return total
    print("This won't be printed")

print(add_numbers(3, 5))
```
```
8
```
A function can only **return** once, thus, if you need to return multiple values, you can use a **list**
```python
def double(a, b):
    return [a*2, b*2]

x = double(5, 7)
print(x)
```
```
[10, 14]
```
