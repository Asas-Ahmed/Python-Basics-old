# Simple Operations

Doing a calculation in Python is simple, just enter it into the print statement:

Multiplication is done using an asterisk symbol *
```python
print(1 + 1)
print(5 + 5 - 5)
print(5 * 2)
print(10 / 2)
```
```
2
5
10
5.0
```
> See the spaces around the plus sign? The code will work without them – but including them makes it a lot easier to read.

Just like in regular math, we can use parentheses to indicate the operations we want performed:
```python
print(2 + 2 * (5 * 2) - 1)
```
```
21
```
> Make sure to close all your parentheses.

One of the things that is great about Python is that it can perform operations with really big numbers.
```python
print(12345 * 987654321)
```
```
12192592592745
```
# Negative Numbers
You can use the minus sign in front of a number to make it negative.
```python
print(-5 * 3)
```
```
-15
```
